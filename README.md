# Doa & Dzikr App
A Doa and Dzikr app is a mobile application designed, particularly Muslims, in their spiritual practices by providing a convenient and organized platform for accessing prayers (Doa) and remembrance of Allah (Dzikir). 

These app serve as a digital tool for users to engage in their religious rituals and connect with their faith more easily.
